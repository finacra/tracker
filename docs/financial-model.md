## Breakeven Analysis (3-4 Year Timeline)

### Revenue Requirements

To break even in 3-4 years with 20% variable costs:
- **Total Fixed Costs (4 years)**: ₹4,12,00,000
- **Total CapEx (Year 1)**: ₹35,00,000
- **Total Costs (4 years)**: ₹4,47,00,000 (fixed + CapEx) + variable costs
- **Contribution Margin**: 80% (after variable costs)
- **Required Revenue (4 years)**: ₹4,47,00,000 ÷ 0.80 = **₹5,58,75,000**
- **Average Annual Revenue Target**: **₹1,39,68,750**
- **Average Monthly Revenue Target**: **₹11,64,063**

### Break-Even Point Calculation

**Formula**: Fixed Costs ÷ (Price - Variable Cost per Unit)

For our SaaS model:
- **Break-even customers** = Annual Fixed Costs ÷ (Average Revenue per Customer × Contribution Margin)
- At ₹60,000 average annual revenue per customer: 1,03,00,000 ÷ (60,000 × 0.80) = **~215 customers** (Year 2+)
- **With CapEx in Year 1**: Need higher revenue in Year 1 to cover one-time costs

### Break-Even Scenarios (3-4 Year Timeline)

**Scenario A: Current Pricing (₹60,000 avg/customer/year)**
- Year 1: Need ₹1,38,00,000 ÷ 0.80 = ₹1,72,50,000 revenue = **~288 customers**
- Year 2: Need ₹1,03,00,000 ÷ 0.80 = ₹1,28,75,000 revenue = **~215 customers**
- Year 3: Need ₹1,03,00,000 ÷ 0.80 = ₹1,28,75,000 revenue = **~215 customers**
- Year 4: Need ₹1,03,00,000 ÷ 0.80 = ₹1,28,75,000 revenue = **~215 customers**
- **Total 4-year**: Need **~933 customers** (achievable with growth trajectory)

**Scenario B: Moderate Growth (₹60,000 avg/customer/year)**
- Year 1: 50 customers = ₹30,00,000 revenue
- Year 2: 100 customers = ₹60,00,000 revenue
- Year 3: 150 customers = ₹90,00,000 revenue
- Year 4: 200 customers = ₹1,20,00,000 revenue
- **Total 4-year**: 500 customers = ₹3,00,00,000 revenue
- **Status**: ⚠️ Below breakeven, need more customers or higher pricing

**Scenario C: Aggressive Growth (₹60,000 avg/customer/year)**
- Year 1: 75 customers = ₹45,00,000 revenue
